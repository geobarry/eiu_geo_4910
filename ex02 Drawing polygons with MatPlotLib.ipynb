    "# Exercise 2: Drawing Polygons (Lists, Tuples, Plotting and Looping)\n",
    "This exercise introduces two of the most important concepts in programming: managing a large `list` of values and processing a list by performing repetitive operations in a `loop`. It also introduces the plotting library `matplotlib`, `tuples` (immutable lists), a standard way of representing a polygon in Python as a list of tuples, and the `zip` function for converting between a list of tuples and a pair of lists. \n",
